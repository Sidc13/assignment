ASSIGNMENT:

Have a look at this dataset at Keggle: NASA Battery Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickfleith/nasa-battery-dataset/data

A set of Li-ion batteries were run through different operational profiles (charge, discharge and impedance) at various temperatures. 
Impedance measurement was carried out through an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) frequency sweeping from 0.1Hz to 5kHz

Repeated charge and discharge cycles result in accelerated aging of the batteries while impedance measurements provide insight into 
the internal battery parameters that change as aging progresses. The experiments were stopped when the batteries reached end-of-life (EOL) criteria. 


From this dataset, could you create plots using plotly (https://plotly.com/) showing how the following battery paramaters are changing 
as the battery cell is aging through charge/discharge cycles.
